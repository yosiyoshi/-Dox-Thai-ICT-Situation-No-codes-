By the initiative of the Digital Economy Promotion Agency(DEPA) in collaboration with the private sectors, they encourage a youth-educational
project named "Coding Thailand" to develop computational thinking skills. DEPA, an agency under "กระทรวงดิจิทัลเพื่อเศรษฐกิจและสังคม (the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society, abb. MDES)",
and the private sector, is leading this project aimed to reach more than 10 million people within three years. It's influenced by "Thailand 4.0", the governmental long-term Hi-Tech development plan aiming "Industry 4.0" or "4th Industrial Revolution".


Here is quote from the article:


The main principle of Coding Thailand is that any medium can be used as a learning tool for the youth. According to MDES Minister Pichet Durongkaveroj, devices such as mobile phones, laptops, tablets or any other smart device can be used to reach the ultimate goal, which is to educate Thais. 
The MDES has assigned DEPA to implement Coding Thailand as an online learning platform to promote digital technologies and computer science, as well as to instil systematic thinking in Thais.

Dr Nuttapon said that initially, the coding programme will be conducted to 5,000 schools in the DEPA network. 
Private sector players who have contributed to the project are Microsoft, Cisco, Google, Aksorn Education among others.
